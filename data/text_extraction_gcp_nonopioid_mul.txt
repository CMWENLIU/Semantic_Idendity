/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/4a3b87bc-d913-6c88-e054-00144ff8d46c_2757_3.jpg	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline. Phamacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released in the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (-90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine. INDICATION: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the treatment of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse has not been tested among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, see PRECAUTIONS. CONTRANDICATIONS: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients. WARNINGS: The effect of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse on periodontitis has not been determined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine. SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS. 
/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/4a3b87bc-d913-6c88-e054-00144ff8d46c_2757_4.jpg	PRECAUTIONS: General: 1. For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis. 2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In clinical testing. 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months: 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations. 3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance Pregnancy. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is administered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 mL (2 capfuls) of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse per day. 
/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/4a3b87bc-d913-6c88-e054-00144ff8d46c_2757_5.jpg	Pediatric Use: Clinical effectiveness and safety of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse have not been established in children under the age of 18. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In a drinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinses are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces; 2) an increase in calculus formation, and 3) an alteration in taste perception; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS. Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer. grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation. coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1%. Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glossal edema, and paresthesia. Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. OVERDOSAGE:Ingestion of 1or 2 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse by a small child (-10kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including naus intoxication Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is ingested by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse therapy should be initiated directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months. Recommended use is twice daily rinsing for 30 seconds, morning and evening after tooth brushing. Usual dosage is 15 ml (marked in cap) of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Patients should be instructed to not rinse with water, or other mouthwashes, brush teeth, or eat immediately after using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is not intended for ingestion and should be expectorated after rinsing. HOW SUPPLIED: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is supplied as a blue liquid in 1-pint (473 mL) amber plastic bottles with child-resistant dispensing closures. NDC 65222-800-16.

/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/99da5233-2760-46f6-8fb3-d9df5da70bfb_6216_2.jpg	Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% Rx Only A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. DESCRIPTION Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is a red-orange liquid for topical application, containing the broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent ketoconazole in a concentration of 2% in an aqueous suspension. It also contains: coconut fatty acid diethanolamide, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, FD & C Red No. 40, hydrochloric acid, imidurea, laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, purified water, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, and sodium lauryl ether sulfate. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur use of the medication should be discontinued. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfuror M. orbiculare). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora. Mode of Action - Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell mem- branes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2- (2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1- ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy] phenylpiperazine and has the following structural formula: Microbiology - Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur). Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility - Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. and irritation occurred in less than 1% of patients. In three open- label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. their frequency.

/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/21b03b2a-44ee-41c0-e054-00144ff8d46c_6519_3.jpg	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during aral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activi- ties is not dear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month dinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline. Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approxl- mately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rins- ing. This retained drug is slowly released in the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 moa/a in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexi- dine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (-90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate Ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine. INDICATION: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the treatment of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse has not been test- ed among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gin- givitis and periodontitis, see PRECAUTIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients WARNINGS: The effect of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse on periodontitis has not been deter- mined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine. SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS 
/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/21b03b2a-44ee-41c0-e054-00144ff8d46c_6519_4.jpg	PRECAUTIONS: General: 1. For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major indicator de underlying periodontitis. 2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restora- tions, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In dinical testing, 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measur- able increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these sur- faces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations 3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexi- dine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300mg/kg/day and 40mg/kg/day respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if dearty needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is admin- istered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at does that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 ml 2 capfuls) of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse per day

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In a drinking water study in rats. carcino- genic effects were not observed at doses up to 38mgka day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000mgkg/day and 250mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100mg/kg/day. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rises are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces 2 an increase in calculus for mation and 3) an alteration in taste perception, see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS. Oral irritation and bcal allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1%. Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glos- sal edema, and paresthesia. Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. OVERDOSAGE: Ingestion of 1 or 2 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse by a small child (-10kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including nausea, or signs of alcohol intoxication Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is ingest- ed by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chlorhexidine aluconate oral rinse therapy should be initiat- ed directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months. Recommended use is twice daily rinsing for 30 seconds, moming and evening after tooth brushing. Usual dosage is 15 ml (marked in cap) of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Patients should be instructed to not rinse with water, or other mouthwashes, brush teeth, or eat immediately after using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is not intended for ingestion and should be expectorated after rinsing.

NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE. EXCESSIVE DOSAGE, OR SHORT INTERVALS BETWEEN DOSES, CAN RESULT IN HIGH PLASMA LEVELS OF LIDOCAINE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS, PATIENTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES AS SET FORTH IN THIS PACKAGE INSERT. THE MANAGEMENT OF SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT, OXYGEN, AND OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS. INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1. Indications: Painful wounds such as post-surgical incisions, ulcers, cuts and abrasions. LDO Plus is a medicated Hydrogel wound dressing in a Metered Dose (MDOSE*") bottle containing lidocaine 4%, an amide type local anesthetic, indicated for: Painful wounds such as post-surgical incisions, cuts and abrasions. 2. Dosage and Administration:Each pump of the LDO Plus MDOSE bottle (30mL Airless Metered Dose bottle) (NDC:35781-0500-3) will deliver 0.25 mL of LDO Plus (10 mg Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP), enough to cover a 2 inch by 2 inch area of skin. A single application should not exceed 4 pumps of the MDOSE bottle, equal to 1 gram of LDO Plus, (40 mg of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP). DOSAGE Apply to the affected area as directed. Maximum 12 pumps per day. No more than 12 pumps of the MDOSE bottle, approximately 3 grams of LDO Plus (120 mg Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP,) should be administered in any one day. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Although the incidence of adverse effects with LDO Plus is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered. LDO Plus is a topical medicated hydrogel wound dressing. Each gram of LDO Plus contains 4% Lidocaine HCI USP (40mg). CONTRAINDICATIONS Traumatized mucosa, secondary bacterial infection of the area of proposed application and known hypersensitivity to any of the components. 2.1 Dosage for children: The recommend dose of LDO Plus varies as a function of age and weight. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule). For example, a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg (approximately 1.9 to 2.5 grams of LDO Plus) when calculated according to Clark's rule. In general, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight of the child. Do not use on children under 2 unless directed by a physician. Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type. 2.2 Administration: Apply as directed. Do not exceed 12 pumps in a twenty-four-hour (24-hour) period. One pump covers an area of 2 x2 inches. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS For External Use Only. Avoid Contact with Eyes. If irritation or sensitivity occurs or infection appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 3. Dosage Form and Strength:LDO Plus is a topical medicated hydrogel wound dressing. Each gram of LDO Plus contains 4% Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP (40mg). LDO Plus should be used with caution in ill, elderly, debilitated patients and children who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP. 4.Contraindications: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type or to other components of LDO Plus. Do not use LDO Plus on traumatized mucosa or in the presence of secondary bacterial infection of the area of proposed application. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are redness or swelling at the application site. Less common side effects, such as sluggishness, confusion, slow breathing, low blood pressure, or slow heartbeat, may occur. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gensco Pharma at 866-608-6284 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 5. Warnings and Precautions: If irritation or sensitivity occurs or infection appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. LDO Plus should be used with caution in ill, elderly, debilitated patients and children who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP. In case of accidental ingestion get medical help or contact poison control center right away. DRUG INTERACTIONS 6. Adverse Reactions: Adverse experiences following the administration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage or rapid absorption, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Prilocaine, Bupivacaine, Amyl nitrates/sodium nitrate/sodium thiosulfate, Dofetilide. Lomitapide, Beta- lockers (e.g., atenolol), Cimetidine, or Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (ex. Mexiletine). This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if LDO Plus may interact with other medicines that you take. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 6.1 Central nervous system: CNS manifestations of Lidocaine toxicity are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Use in Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category B. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is administered to a nursing woman. 6.2 Cardiovascular system: Cardiovascular manifestations of Lidocaine toxicity are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Pediatric use: Dosage in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight and physical condition. 6.3 Allergic: Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to the local anesthetic agent or to other components in the formulation. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Geriatric use: No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between the healthy elderly and other adult patients.

Drug Interactions: 10.1 Active Ingredients: Each gram of LDO Plus contains Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP 4% (40 mg). Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is chemically designated as acetamide, 2- (diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), and has the following structure: 7.1 Serious interactions: Antiarrhythmic Drugs: LDO Plus should be used with caution in patients receiving Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially Synergistic. Bupivacaine liposome: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP increases toxicity of Bupivacaine by increasing the free (unencapsulated) bupiacaine. Dofetilide: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP increases effects of dofetilide thru pharmacodynamic synergism. Lomitapide: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP increases levels of lomitapide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzymes CYP3A4 metabolism. 10.2 Inactive ingredients: Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 400 & Polyethylene Glycol 3350 as base, Oak Extract, Meadowsweet Extract, Zinc Acetate, and Water. 11. Clinical Pharmacology: 7.2 General interactions: Drugs metabolized via CYP3A4 enzyme: (ex. Antipsychotics, SSRIs, TCAs, many chemotherapeutics, calcium channel bockers, benzodiazopines) Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP may increase serum levels of many drugs metabolized by hepatic / intestinal CYP3A4 enzymes. Drugs that affect hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme: (ex. Quinoline antibiotics, cimetidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, erythromycin) May increase serum Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP levels by decreasing Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP metabolism by CYP1A2 enzyme. 11.1 Mechanism of action:LDO Plus is a hydrated polymer (Hydrogel) wound dressing containing 4% w/w Lidocaine HCI USP. By providing moisture to the wound, LDO Plus creates a moist healing environment, which promotes granulation, epithelialization, and autolytic debridement. The high water content of hydrogel dressings cools the wound, producing pain relief that can last up to 6 hours. Dressing-change discomfort is also reduced because LDO Plus doesn't adhere to the wound surface. LDO Plus releases Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP from the Neutral (pH 7-7.2) hydrogel to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. 8. Use in Specific Populations: 11.2 Onset of anesthesia:LDO Plus effects local, topical anesthesia. The onset of action is 3-5 minutes. 11.3 Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. 8.1 Use in Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 6.6 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus caused by Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP. There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place. 8.2 Labor and Delivery: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should LDO Plus be used concomitantly with other products containing Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP, the total dose contributed by all formulations must be kept in mind. 8.3 Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is administered to a nursing woman. 11.4 Pharmacokinetics and metabolism: Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes or open wounds, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N- dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP. Approximately 90% of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6- dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 ug of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-l-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP is metabolized, any Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. 8.4 Pediatric use: Dosage in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight and physical condition. Caution must be taken to avoid over dosage when applying LDO Plus to large areas of injured or abraded skin, since the systemic absorption of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP may be increased under such conditions. Do not use on children under 2 unless directed by a physician. 8.5 Geriatric use: No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between the healthy elderly and other adult patients. 9. Over Dosage: Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics. (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).- Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 ug free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 pg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity 9.1 Management of local anesthetic emergencies: The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness after each local anesthetic administration. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered. The first step in the management of convulsions consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. 12. Non-Clinical Toxicity: Studies of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been conducted. 13. How Supplied / Storage and Handling: HOW SUPPLIED:LDO Plus (Medicated Hydrogel containing Lidocaine HCI USP 4%) Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind that drugs used to treat convulsions sometimes depress the circulation when administered intravenously. Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (e.g., ephedrine). 1.0 oz (28.5g) 30ml Airless Pump - NDC 35781-0500-3 STORE AND DISPOSE OF THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND PETS.

Fluconazole is a unique treatment for vaginal yeast infections because it is taken orally. Just one oral tablet provides a full course of therapy sufficient to cure most vaginal yeast infections...it's that easy. Some important things to know about Fluconazole. Fluconazole may be taken anytime - day or night, with or without meals - So you should take it by mouth immediately to ensure the earliest possible relief from the infection and its symptoms. Clearing a yeast infection does take time. Although Fluconazole is taken only once, Fluconazole remains active in your body for several days. Most patients can expect to see symptoms relief begin within 24 hours after taking the tablet. As Fluconazole works to cure the infection, Symptoms will lessen and eventually disappear. If your symptoms have not improved within 3 to 5 days, contact your doctor. In U.S. studies of Fluconazole, the most common side effects were headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Most reported side effects were mild to moderate in nature. Do not take Fluconazole if you are taking the medication Propulsid (cisapride). If you have any questions, or for more information about Fluconazole and the treatment of vaginal yeast infections, ask your doctor, healthcare provider or pharmacist. 130.00 mm The easy ORAL cure for most vaginal yeast infections.

Muscle or joint pain can be due to musculoligamentous strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains. If consulted by your physician, it may be used for other conditions as well. Directions: Apply patch to affected area 1 to 2 times daily or as directed by physician Instructions for Use: 1. Clean and dry the affected area 2. Open pouch and remove one patch 3. Remove any protective film and apply directly to affected area of pain 4. Wash hands with soap and water after applying patch 5. Reseal pouch containing unused patches after each use 6. Pain relief varies from patient to patient, may need to use a few times to see benefit. Mechanism of Action: Menthol has some local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities and also acts as a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist making it an analgesic as well. Its ability to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for its cooling sensation when applied to the skin. Lastly, it enhances the efficacy of other topical applications by increasing penetration via vasodilatation. Lidocaine is a common local anesthetic that relieves itching, burning, and pain. Topically, it blocks both initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing ionic flux through the neuronal membrane. Since it penetrates the skin, it creates an anesthetic effect by not just preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by stopping them before they begin. Methyl Salicylate also known as wintergreen oil, is a natural product from many plant species. It is topically used to cause dilation of the capillaries thereby increasing blood flow to the area. Capsaicin is an active component from chili peppers that produces a burning sensation on the skin. The true mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a neuropeptide- active agent that decreases and depletes the synthesis, storage, transport, and releases of substance P. Substance P is thought to be the principal chemical mediator of pain impulses from the periphery to the central nervous system. It is also hypothesized that substance P is released into the joint tissues where it activates an inflammatory response. When capsaicin 
/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/b55585cf-45da-4b78-b68e-f7dddf23bfe7_15731_4.jpg	depletes substance P in the nerve endings, the local pain impulses can no longer be transmitted to the brain. Benefits: The use of this topical medication, 19 Medx Patch, over other oral options for pain relief can benefit patients in many different ways. Conventional therapies using opioids (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone) can cause systemic adverse effects such as constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, sedation, and/or confusion. NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) can increase cardiovascular risk, decrease platelet aggregation, and cause gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers. Other classes of medications such as antidepressants (nortriptyline, duloxetine) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin) also come with its costs and side effects. 1o MedX Patch acts only locally since it's a transdermal patch. In addition, patients can have one or multiple disease states including renal or hepatic dysfunction which can prevent them from taking ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) respectively. More importantly, this patch gives physicians an option to provide effective pain relief treatment while avoiding the addictive properties of conventional oral medications. It can also be supplemented with other topical pain lotions. In addition, it avoids messy application and reduces risk of getting ingredients in eyes or other mucous membranes. Product Information and Data: Pharmacists that have been in the field of pain management for many years used research from all parts of the world to carefully formulate this patch in order to maximize its pain relieving properties. Skin penetrating mixtures have also been added to enhance rapid absorption of the active ingredients through the skin to allow deeper penetration into the muscles, joints, and nerves. Lidocaine patches for therapy of neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain was concluded to be an effective and safe option for add-on therapy" (Nervenarzt, 2010) in a clinical case series using 87 patients.iv Another study in 2010 concluded that a single 8 hour application of a combination patch of menthol provided significant pain relief associated with mild to moderate strains when compared to a placebo patch. The use of these pharmaceutical and natural components provides more pain relief and makes the patch a new way to address pain. These ingredients comply with The Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines and the ACOEM guidelines for pain management.vi Page 111 of the Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines concludes that topical analgesics are "primarily recommended for neuropathic pain when trials of antidepressants and anticonvulsants have failed (Namaka, 2004)." In addition to this, these agents are applied locally to painful areas with advantages that include lack of systemic side effects, absence of drug interactions, and no need to titrate (Colombo, 2006 Adverse Reactions: Even though adverse reactions are rare, a very small percentage of patients experience an unpleasant burning sensation, redness, warmth, or stinging. Please be aware of any unpleasant side effects as described. If any of these effects persists or worsens, contact your physician or pharmacist immediately. Discontinue use immediately and contact your pharmacist or physician. This is not a complete list of all side effects that may occur. You may report side effects to the FDA at 800-FDA-1088 or at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch. Warnings: Only for external use only. Use only as directed or by a health professional.

The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activi- ties is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes In bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline. Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse Indicate approxi- mately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rins- Ing. This retained drug is slowly released in the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human sublects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexi- dine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate Ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine. INDICATION: Chlorhexidine aluconate oral rinse is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the treatment of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse has not been test- ed among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gin- givitis and periodontitis, see PRECAUTIONS. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients. WARNINGS: The effect of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse on periodontitis has not been deter- mined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at Intervals not greater than six months.Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine. SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS. 
/data/lwu/FDALabel/Opioid_Mining/data/img_saved/4a2bd280-918d-0e26-e054-00144ff88e88_28489_4.jpg	PRECAUTIONS: General: 1. For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival Inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major Indicator of underlying periodontitis. 2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restora- tions, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstalning. In clinical testing, 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measur- able Increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these sur- faces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations. 3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexi- dine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300mg/kg/day and 40mg/kg/day respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is admin- istered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 ml (2 capfuls) of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse per day.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: In a drinking water study in rats, carcino genic effects were not observed at doses up to 38mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000mg/kg/day and 250mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100mg/kg/day. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinses are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces: 2) an increase in calculus for- mation, and an alteration in taste perceptionsee WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1%. Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glos- sal edema, and paresthesia Minor imitation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. OVERDOSAGE: Ingestion of 1 or 2 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse by a small child (~10kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including nausea, or signs of alcohol intoxication Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is ingest- ed by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chlorhexidine aluconate oral rinse therapy should be initiat- ed directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months Recommended use is twice daily rinsing for 30 seconds, morning and evening after tooth brushing. Usual dosage is 15 ml (marked in cap) of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Patients should be Instructed to not rinse with water, or other mouthwashes, brush teeth, or eat immediately after using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is not intended for ingestion and should be expectorated after rinsing.

The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial ativities is not clear Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, boh grobic and anosobie, ranging from 54-97% frough six months of use Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant change in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral tinseuse was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque hod retumed to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconale oral rinse Indioale approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released in the oral fluids. Studie oonducted on human subjects and animals demonstrale chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal trad. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mog/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300 mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Exoration of chlorhexidine glupodle occurred primarily through the fees (-90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine INDICATION: Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the reament of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing.

For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival Inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluponate oral rinse should not be used as a major Indicator of underlying periodontitis 2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant Increase in tooth staining. In clinical testing, 50% of chlahexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measurable Increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate al rise users developed what was judged to be heavy stain compared to 1% d control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier cumulations of unremoved plaque Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivoe or other oral issues. Sain oan be removed from most looh surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these sur les by a dental prophylands, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine glucondo oral inse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and one oasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations 3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral tinse Rare Instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse we have been reported via post-marketing produet surveillance Pregnancy: Teratogenlo Effects Pregnancy Category B. reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doces up to 300 mgkg/day and 40 mgkg/day respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal production studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if dearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are screted in human milk, odlution should be sercised when chlorhexidine gluconate oral inge is administered to nursing woman In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition of toxic affects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams a doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 ml (2 capfuls) of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rines per day Pediatric Use: Clinical effectiveness and safely d chlorhexidine gluconde oral inse have not been established in children under the age of 18 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: nadrinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic allods were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cylogenetics test were 1000 mg/kg/day and 250 mgkg/dby, respectively.

NDC 70771-1065-7 Fluconazole Tablet, USP 150 mg Rx only 1 Blister x 1 Tablet *Due to Candida Directions: Push tablet through foil and take by mouth C D Your doctor has prescribed fluconazole for a vaginal yeast infection Fluconazole is a unique treatment for vaginal yeast infections because it is taken orally. Just one oral tablet provides a full course of therapy sufficient to cure most vaginal yeast infections...it's that easy. Some important things to know about fluconazole Fluconazole may be taken anytime--day or night, with or without meals-so you should take it by mouth immediately to ensure the earliest possible relief from the infection and its symptoms. • Clearing a yeast infection does take time. Although fluconazole is taken only once, fluconazole remains active in your body for several days. Most patients can expect to see symptom relief begin within 24 hours after taking the tablet. As fluconazole works to cure the infection, Symptoms wil lessen and eventually disappear. If your symptoms have not improved within 3 to 5 days, contact your doctor. • In U.S. studies of fluconazole, the most common side effects were headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Most reported side effects were mild to moderate in nature. Do not take fluconazole if you are taking the medication Propulsid® (cisapride) • If you have any questions, or for more information about fluconazole and the treatment of vaginal yeast infections, ask your doctor, healthcare provider or pharmacist.

Fluconazole is a unique treatment for vaginal yeast infections because it is taken orally. Just one oral tablet provides a full course of therapy sufficient to cure most vaginal yeast infections...it's that easy. Some important things to know about Fluconazole. Fluconazole may be taken anytime-day or night, with or without meals - So you should take it by mouth immediately to ensure the earliest possible relief from the infection and its symptoms. Clearing a yeast infection does take time. Although Fluconazole is taken only once, Fluconazole remains active in your body for several days. Most patients can expect to see symptoms relief begin within 24 hours after taking the tablet. As Fluconazole works to cure the infection, symptoms wil lessen and eventually disappear. If your symptoms have not improved within 3 to 5 days, contact your doctor. In U.S. studies of Fluconazole, the most common side effects were headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Most reported side effects were mild to moderate in nature. Do not take Fluconazole if you are taking the medication Propulsid® (cisapride). If you have any questions, or for more information about Fluconazole and the treatment of vaginal yeast infections, ask your doctor, healthcare provider or pharmacist. The easy ORAL cure for most vaginal yeast infections. Directions: Push tablet through foil and take by mouth *Due to Candida Propulsid (cisapride) is a registered trademark of Janssen Pharmaceutica.
